# React
Exploring React 
- Building React project from scratch by using CDN Links of react and react-dom library.
- CDN hosts libraries or assets on servers distributed globally.
- When a CDN link is added in HTML, the browser fetches the file from the nearest server, improving speed and reducing load time.
